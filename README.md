# twilioapp

Web app built with angularjs frontend and nodejs backend, using express. Hosted on heroku. Allows you to upload an mp3 file and send it to a designated phone number.

To use:
1) git clone repo
2) npm install
3) bower install
4) grunt
5) deploy using nodemon/node
6) test on localhost

Note: Hosting on heroku was taken down due to excessive use (twilio api costs money to use)
